## But first, what's `quarto`?

> `quarto` is a new open-source scientific and technical publishing system.

. . .

* Quarto combines the functionality of `R Markdown`, `bookdown`, `distill`, `xaringan`, etc. into a single consistent system with "batteries included"

## What's so exciting about Quarto?

<br>

![](images/jj-hangout.jpg){width="600"}

. . .

"Quarto is really **powerful and flexible**, and easy to use for a certain subset of users who are very technical and very motivated, but we actually want to make Quarto available more broadly. So working on **tooling that lets both technical and non technical people collaborate** over documents, and also lets some less technical people participate in using Quarto." | [Data Science Hangout recording](https://youtu.be/mqOva6Y0xFo)

## "Have any tips for building a community?"

 -some 3+ people 😊

## Make things ~~easy~~ easier for yourself

* Start with something off the [Quarto gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/#websites) or another Quarto site you've seen and admire!

## Fork their `r fontawesome::fa("github", "black")` repo and adjust from there!

* Thank you to Julia Stewart Lowndes and Stefanie Butland who created the Openscapes [Quarto Website Tutorial](https://github.com/openscapes/quarto-website-tutorial) that provided the framework for my site.
* A template might not fit your exact needs, but for your first site it gives you a great starting point to learn

## What I wanted to create: 
### A section of the site that references a bunch of other resources

<br>

I learned that this is called a listing page - specifically listings from data

* [Hamel Husain documents this here](https://hamel.dev/notes/quarto/listings-from-data.html)

## Listings from data (blogs, apps, webinars, websites, etc.)

<br>

Listings enable you to automatically generate the contents of a page (or region of a page) from a list of Quarto documents or other custom data.

<br>

For my site this was:

* **resources.qmd** *(my listing page)*
* **resources folder** with the following:
  - metadata.yml file *(where I included the contents of everything for the listing page above)*
  - images folder *(for the blog, webinar, website preview images)*

## resources.qmd

<br>

![](images/resources.jpg)

<br>

```{code-fold}
---
title: "Community Examples & Resources"
listing:
  id: community-listing
  contents:
    - "metadata.yml"
  type: grid
  fields: [date, title, categories, author, subtitle, image]
  categories: true
  sort: "date desc"
  image-height: 100%
